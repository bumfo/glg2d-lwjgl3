/**
 * When the component being painting is not part of an existing Swing hierarchy
 * and therefore not receiving standard AWT events, the UI will not function as
 * expected. Reshape events will not be propagated and many features of Swing
 * components will not be available (e.g. indeterminate progress bars).
 * 
 * <p>
 * This will initialize the component as if it was part of a Swing hierarchy on
 * the first call to {@code init(GLDrawable)}. This will listen for reshape
 * events and ensure the component being painted fills the entire canvas. This
 * is useful when painting a Swing component into a NEWT window and the Swing
 * component takes up the entire NEWT frame.
